# polyhedron
Experimenting with Goldberg polyhedrons and porting portions of Polyhedronism (Levskaya) to Rblx.Lua.

## Progression of development
### Starting out
I adapted a lot of code from Levskaya's polyHédronisme, including the creation of Polyhedron objects and Conway's polyhedron operations. This created the base for drawing the objects in Roblox.

Implementing preliminary vertex and face center drawing. Green = vertex, red = face center.
